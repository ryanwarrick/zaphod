# Instance Folder - General Info
Flask websites use '[instance folders](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/#instance-folders)' to hold files for use by the web application. In the Zaphod web app, files such as blog and article markdown source documents are housed here.

This directory illustrates a example instance folder populated with valid content to provide a plug-and-play solution to demonstrate the Zaphod web app project.

# Procedures For Using this Example Instance Folder
1. Launch app within your deployment/production virtual environment at least once, thereby automatically creating an instance folder.*
2. Once created, populate the auto-generated instance folder with the contents of this directory.
3. Relaunch web app and re-initialize database.*

\* See the "App Content Data" section of the project root README.md for more info.

# Regarding the Example Content Within
Filler content used for site development, testing, and design purposes was procured from random Wikipedia articles.
